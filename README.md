# CO2EmissionsModelTesting

Loads SQuAD dataset to train large language models. Uses the CodeCarbon package's CO2 emissions tracker to measure CO2 emissions and RAM usage. The models trained on SQuAD data, after making inferences on samples from the SQuAD and AdversarialQA dataset, are then evaluated on the cosine similarity, STS (BERT-Embedding), STS (OpenAI-Embedding), and STS (Palm-Embedding) metrics.
